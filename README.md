# godless-guessing-game
godless guessing game (or ggg/3g) is a little guessing game written in rust.

powered by nihilism, inspired by nietsche's _god is dead._

_**please note**: the godless guessing game is not meant to offend anyone. i'm sorry if it does. this project was born out of boredom and i figured others might enjoy it too._

## installation
the godless guessing game needs to be run from the source code. install [rust](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install) before proceeding.

```
git clone https://github.com/hloroforma/godless-guessing-game.git
cd godless-guessing-game
cargo run
```

## actually playing the game
the game itself is short, simple, and frankly pretty boring. just input a number and it'll tell you if it's correct or not. the game ends upon guessing the correct number, but you can run `cargo run` to play again.

you are free to edit the source code to your liking. go ham.
